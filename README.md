# Shadow

R implementation of the research project *Civil War in the Shadow of Intervention*.

This project reproduces and extends the modeling and prediction pipeline described in the original working paper.
It includes:

- A formal model of onset and intervention
- An ensemble-based machine learning model to predict intervention expectations
- A statistical model of civil war onset incorporating intervention expectations
- Visualizations and robustness checks

Structure:
- `R/`: model and data scripts
- `data/`: raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: exploratory and final RMarkdown reports
- `outputs/`: figures and tables
